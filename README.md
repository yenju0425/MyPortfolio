# [My "Poker" Portfolio ‚ô†Ô∏è ‚ô•Ô∏è ‚ô¶Ô∏è ‚ô£Ô∏è](http://13.211.167.3:3000)

I'm excited to share my portfolio with you! I've put a lot of effort into this project and I'm proud of the results. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I do!

This portfolio is built using Next.js and Socket.io, creating an immersive gaming experience through a real-time online poker game. While the backend logic is almost complete, the frontend part is still a work in progress. I will continue working on it and regularly update this repository, so stay tuned for more updates!
