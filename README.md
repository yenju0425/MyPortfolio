# My "Poker" Portfolio

I'm very excited to share my portfolio with you! I've been working on it for a while now, and I'm proud of the results. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

This project is built using Next.js and Socket.io, offering an immersive gaming experience through a real-time online poker game. While the backend logic is almost done, the frontend part is still a work in progress. I'll be updating it as soon as I finish it.
